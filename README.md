# Words About Code

This is my experiment about publishing words about code using Github as
a blog. Thanks for reading.

### Rails internals series

I'm writing a rails internals series, here are all the posts so far:

* [Rails Internals: Inside Active Model Attribute Methods](https://github.com/oscardelben/words-about-code/blob/master/2012/04/rails-internals-inside-attribute-methods.md)
* [Rails Internals: Mass Assignment Security](https://github.com/oscardelben/words-about-code/blob/master/2012/04/rails-internals-mass-assignment-security.md)
* [Rails Internals: Observers](https://github.com/oscardelben/words-about-code/blob/master/2012/04/rails-internals-active-model-observers.md)

### Why Github?

I want to think about words and code, not hosting, css or anything else
for that matter. Github allowes me to do just that.
