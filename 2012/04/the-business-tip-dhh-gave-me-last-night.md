# The Business Tip DHH Gave me Last Night

I had a dream the other night. I was sitting in a room with a few other
people and David was giving a presentation about his history building
products. I don't remember how I got there, but he was trying so hard
to say that **to be successful in our business, you have to work on
the hard problems, and keep doing it**. I then woke up and thought about
it for a few seconds, then returned to sleep, and thought some more, I
eventually woke up the next day.

It's not like DHH gave me this tip for real of course. Still,
I started to think about the meaning of those words, fealing they were
hiding an important message.

I looked at the note again today, and decided it was time to give it its
voice. I started thinking about my [open source
projects](https://github.com/oscardelben),
[some](https://github.com/oscardelben/RailsOneClick)
[of](https://github.com/oscardelben/Color-Picker-Pro)
[them](https://github.com/oscardelben/rawler)
[successful](https://github.com/oscardelben/sheet). It became clear that
what DHH was trying to say in my dream was to focus on solving the hard
problems and opportunities that my *existing* projects presented,
instead of being constantly looking for the new opportunities, and
that if I were to do that every day they'd eventually become even more
successful.

The same advice applies to the products I'd build too. It's not the idea
you have, it's how well you execute it, iteration after iteration. It's
the care you take in every step of the process. DHH was trying to tell
me that even my half baked idea could be very successful, if only I'd
focus and work long enough on it, solving new problems with creativity
and dedication. And patience.

This was only a dream, and I don't know DHH personally, but the advice
is still solid. I hope it can inspire you to build great things too, like
it did for me.
